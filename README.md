# RISC-V-Single-Cycle-Processor
The aim of this project is to learn Verilog and learn the basics of CPU architecture. Using Verilogm, I implemented a RISC-V architecture to create a 32-bit, single-cycle processor that can perform 18 operations. The diagram linked demonstrates the datapath I followed, omitting the control modules.
